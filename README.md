**RPA Extracted Workflow**

This is a demonstration of a basic extracted workflow.

The main workflow is responsible only for opening and closing the web browser. It calls another workflow which knows how to do a basic search on a YouTube channel.

This project is simple, but shows the power of extracted workflows in RPA. They act like functions or methods, encapsulating specific units of work which can be reused again in other projects. 

Since this is a basic example, there is no error checking. Real working code would of course have error handling included.
